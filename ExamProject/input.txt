NASA’s newest space telescope, 100 SPHEREx, designed to seek out the ke8y ingredients for life in the Milky Way1, and a sun-focused mission called PUNCH 222, will have to wait a bit longer to lift off to space together 333, according to the 5space agency.

Both missions 444 were expected to launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon9 rocket at 10 p.m. ET (7 PT) Saturday from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. But NASA and SpaceX announced 555 mission teams were standing down from the attempt.

“The additional time 777 will allow teams to continue rocket checkouts ahead of liftoff,” according to an update shared 888 by NASA. “A new launch date will be announced once confirmed on the range.”
