Understanding the MVC Framework
The MVC Framework was introduced in the early ASP.NET, long before .NET Core and .NET 6 were
introduced. The original ASP.NET relied on a development model called Web Pages, which re-created the experience of writing desktop applications but resulted in unwieldy web projects that did not scale well.
The MVC Framework was introduced alongside Web Pages with a development model that embraced the character of HTTP and HTML, rather than trying to hide it.
